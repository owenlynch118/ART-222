<p id="project1statemt"> <b> Project Statement:</b> </p>

<p id="stmnt1p1"> My design choices for this Southworth Planetarium logo experiment were inspired by four main themes/items that are closely related to the Southworth Planetarium: astronomy, the shape of a dome, Portland Maine, and a curious individual gazing upward toward the interior of the dome.  
</p>

<p id="stmnt1p2">
The first step I took in designing this logo was tracing the shape of Portland Maine's back Cove. I feel that the Back Cove symbolizes the heart of Portland, so I used this shape as a symbol of the planetarium's hometown and location. I filled the Back Cove shape with dark navy blue and green, the two most prominent colors of the Maine flag. These colors reference the location and history of the planetarium, as well as deep outer space (dark navy blue). I placed a planetary ring around the Back Cove shape to represent a planet and the topic of astronomy which the planetarium is based on. The dome shaped line that arches over the planet symbolizes one of the main attractions of the planetarium, that being the 360 degree projection dome that displays star shows and other astronomy related screenings. The dome shape was chosen because it represents a core component of the planetarium, but it is also intended to add a sense of upward movement to the design and emphasize the shape of the planet. The star in the upper left corner of the design is another reference to astronomy and outer space, but it is also intended to activate the negative space that surrounds the planet and add some imbalance to the design to make it more engaging and memorable.
</p>

<p id="stmnt1p3">
In one of the my designs, I included a small figure atop the planet that appears to be gazing up at the dome. This is another reference to the planetarium’s 360 degree projection dome. The figure represents an audience member engaged in one of the planetarium's screenings or presentations. This addition was intended to enhance the message of the design as well as add a component of wit and complexity. The figure, being placed atop a planet, brings an interesting sense of scale and proportion into the design.  
</p>

<p id="stmnt1p4">  
I have included three different versions, but I am the most fond of the figureless colored one. The colors speak to the intended message of the design and although the figure also does this, its absence adds a layer of simplicity that I feel improves the design by making it more cohesive and memorable.  
</p>

<p id="stmnt1p5">  
Originally, I planned to create a design similar to this one, but after I started creating the final version of my design in illustrator, I realized that I wanted to make some changes. Initially, I planned to have the figure positioned below and gazing up at the planet, and the arching line symbolizing the planetarium’s dome was not included. I felt that this design lacked cohesion and didn't clearly express the message I wanted to convey. The idea to add the dome into the design filled this gap, and from this, I had a clear vision of a human figure gazing up at not the planet, but the dome itself.   
</p>

<p id="stmnt1p6"> 
To make my design versatile and suitable for various applications, I made it nearly circular and added a transparent background. This way, the design can be placed on a variety of backgrounds, colors and shapes.
