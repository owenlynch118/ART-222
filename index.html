<p id="project1"> <b>PROJECT 1</b> </p>

<p id="project1statemt"> <b> Project Statement:</b> </p>

<p id="stmnt1p1"> My design choices for this Southworth Planetarium logo experiment were inspired by four main themes/items that are closely related to the Southworth Planetarium: astronomy, the shape of a dome, Portland Maine, and a curious individual gazing upward toward the interior of the dome.  
</p>

<p id="stmnt1p2">
The first step I took in designing this logo was tracing the shape of Portland Maine's back Cove. I feel that the Back Cove symbolizes the heart of Portland, so I used this shape as a symbol of the planetarium's hometown and location. I filled the Back Cove shape with dark navy blue and green, the two most prominent colors of the Maine flag. These colors reference the location and history of the planetarium, as well as deep outer space (dark navy blue). I placed a planetary ring around the Back Cove shape to represent a planet and the topic of astronomy which the planetarium is based on. The dome shaped line that arches over the planet symbolizes one of the main attractions of the planetarium, that being the 360 degree projection dome that displays star shows and other astronomy related screenings. The dome shape was chosen because it represents a core component of the planetarium, but it is also intended to add a sense of upward movement to the design and emphasize the shape of the planet. The star in the upper left corner of the design is another reference to astronomy and outer space, but it is also intended to activate the negative space that surrounds the planet and add some imbalance to the design to make it more engaging and memorable.
</p>

<p id="stmnt1p3">
In one of the my designs, I included a small figure atop the planet that appears to be gazing up at the dome. This is another reference to the planetarium’s 360 degree projection dome. The figure represents an audience member engaged in one of the planetarium's screenings or presentations. This addition was intended to enhance the message of the design as well as add a component of wit and complexity. The figure, being placed atop a planet, brings an interesting sense of scale and proportion into the design.  
</p>

<p id="stmnt1p4">  
I have included three different versions, but I am the most fond of the figureless colored one. The colors speak to the intended message of the design and although the figure also does this, its absence adds a layer of simplicity that I feel improves the design by making it more cohesive and memorable.  
</p>

<p id="stmnt1p5">  
Originally, I planned to create a design similar to this one, but after I started creating the final version of my design in illustrator, I realized that I wanted to make some changes. Initially, I planned to have the figure positioned below and gazing up at the planet, and the arching line symbolizing the planetarium’s dome was not included. I felt that this design lacked cohesion and didn't clearly express the message I wanted to convey. The idea to add the dome into the design filled this gap, and from this, I had a clear vision of a human figure gazing up at not the planet, but the dome itself.   
</p>

<p id="stmnt1p6"> 
To make my design versatile and suitable for various applications, I made it nearly circular and added a transparent background. This way, the design can be placed on a variety of backgrounds, colors and shapes.

<p id="project2"> <b>PROJECT 2</b> </p>

<p id="project2statemt"> <b> Project Statement:</b> </p>

<p id="p2paragraph"> For this project, I wanted to create two images that depict scenes from a world or future era in which the concept and worship of money has been abandoned. These scenes are intended to have an initial dystopian appearance, but upon further examination, cause their audience to consider the potential harms of money, and what our world would be like if money was either ignored, or no longer existed. 
</p>

<p id="p2paragraph"> For my first image, I wanted to create a scene that displays a celebration of the abandonment of money. I included an image of a celebration held around a large bonfire. I then layered in an image of burning money over the bonfire to create the illusion that the celebration was dedicated to the burning of money. I added an ominous sky to the background to strengthen the hell-like dystopian appearance. Lastly, I added in two images of the Charging Bull statue which symbolizes Wall Street and overall financial power and success. In front of the two bulls I put jail cell bars to create the illusion that the bulls are locked up. This is intended to act as another symbol of the abandonment of money.
</p>

<p id="p2topic"> <b> Aesthetic choices for scene 1 </b> </p>


<p id="p2sparagraph"> <b>Color:</b> An overarching reddish orange hue over the whole scene. This is intended to create an initial hell-like dystopian appearance. This is also intended to hint at the theme of the abandonment of money because red is a complementary color to green (often associated with money) on the color wheel.  
</p>  

<p id="p2sparagraph"> <b>Line/repetition:</b> The repetition of human figures holding hands forms a line-like shape and is intended to symbolize togetherness and unity.
</p> 

<p id="p2sparagraph"> <b>Balance and alignment:</b> The humans are arranged in a balanced circle and the bulls in the background are mirroring each other. This adds an overall balance to this scene and is intended to convey a sense of unity and control among the human figures. 
</p> 

<p id="p2sparagraph"> <b>Emphasis:</b> The burning pile of money is designed to be the focal point of the scene. It is emphasized by its centrality within the scene.  
</p> 

<p id="p2sparagraph"> <b>Proportion:</b> Both the bulls and the pile of burning money will be unrealistically large compared to the human figures to highlight the massive role that money plays in our world.  
</p> 

<p id="p2paragraph"> For my second image, I wanted to highlight the massive role that money plays in creating power dynamics by creating a scene that depicts a reversal of a familiar power dynamic. I started out with an image of two unhoused people, and replaced their faces with Trump and Musk’s faces. These two individuals hold a great deal of power through their immense monetary wealth. In this image, the thing that brings these two individuals the majority of their power, is being burned and no longer holds value. They are stripped of their dominance. I chose to place this scene (Trump and Musk specifically) in the forest to further illustrate the reversal of this power dynamic. By doing this, these two figures become vulnerable within the scene because they are removed from their typical comfortable industrial habitat. I included the image of the playfully exploring child to add some humor into the scene and also highlight how the abandonment of money would not restrict one from existing playfully and exploring the world, and could potentially even open up more time for such activity.        
</p> 

<p id="p2topic"> <b>Aesthetic choices for scene 2</b> </p> 

<p id="p2sparagraph"> <b>Color:</b> The same overarching reddish orange hue from scene 1. </p> 

<p id="p2sparagraph"> <b>Balance:</b> There is a lack of balance in this scene to create a look of disorder and lack of control. The darkness of the two human figures causes them to carry a visual weight and cause an imbalance. 
</p> 

<p id="p2sparagraph"> <b>Repetition:</b> The piles of burning money are repeated throughout the background of the scene to create a sense of disorder and chaos. 
</p>

<p id="p2sparagraph"> <b>Texture:</b> Texture is used to represent the homeless state of the two human figures, through snarled hair and sleeping pads and blankets laid on the ground. 
</p>

<p id="p2topic"> <b>Concept and inspiration</b> </p>  

<p id="p2paragraph"> I have always been fascinated by the idea of a world without money, or at least a world where money plays a smaller role, is worshipped and pursued less, carries less power, and where there isn't such an expansive gap in wealth equality. It seems that so many of the world's issues, like climate change, crime, social isolation, unfair power dynamics, individuals social alienation, etc.  stem from money, and the vast majority of modern human actions revolve around the goal of wealth creation. I wanted to explore a moneyless world through creating these two images. I want these scenes to invite their viewers to consider the potential harms of money, and how the riddance of money could drastically shift the way we interact with the world.  
</p> 

<p id="p2topic"> <b>Changes made to original plan</b> </p>

<p id="p2paragraph"> Originally I planned to have the second image set in an abandoned apocalyptic city setting to symbolize the deterioration of the industrial world, but after moving forward with the editing and conceptualization of the scene, I decided on a forest setting instead. I made this decision because I felt that a forest setting best illustrated Trump and Musk being stripped of their dominance and familiar environment.
